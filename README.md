# ETL_data_reader
A python package for conveniently loading the ETL data set.

## Intro

The ETL data set is a collection of roughly 1.600.000 handwritten characters.
Notably it includes Japanese Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana.
The data set can be found [here](http://etlcdb.db.aist.go.jp/).
<br/>
However the data set is stored in a custom data structure which is hard to load.
Therefore this python package provides an easy way to load this data set.
